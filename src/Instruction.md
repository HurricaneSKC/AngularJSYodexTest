<!-- Create an AngularJS 1.X single page application that displays a single page that contains the following:

My Sample App:

• Search Posts: <input text></input text>
- Search posts should update the list of existing posts as you type. The search should filter only by post title.

• Existing posts: <list of posts>
Post Title (the title should be camel cased)
Post Body (limit to 100 characters and display “...” if longer than that)
<view comments link>
- When user clicks on <view comments>, a list with the first 3 comments will be displayed inline (no need to load a new page if you don't want to). A comment will include name, email and body.

</list of posts>

• Form to create a new post:
userID: text input
title: text input
body: text input
<create new post></create new post>

- Use  https://github.com/typicode/json-server  to create a fake rest API. Alternatively you can use directly the url  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ .

- When user clicks on <create new post>, we will update list of posts with the new post we have created. Don’t worry about validating the fields.

- No need of pagination, just display the top 20 posts.

- CSS is not really important for this test, so please don't spend much time on this.

- We will evaluate code structure and ability to implement components and how they connect with each other.
- We will also evaluate unit testing and how the developer makes sure everything works as expected. - There is no time limit, but ideally you shouldn't spend more than 1.5 hours.
- Please provide instructions about how to run the application and test it -->
